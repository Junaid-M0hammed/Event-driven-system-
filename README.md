# Recovering Lost Events in a Streaming System 

Everything was running smoothly. Our event-driven system was humming along, processing millions of real-time messages without breaking a sweat.  

Until one day… things didn’t quite add up.  

Numbers started looking *off*. Reports weren’t matching up. Some events were missing entirely, and others seemed to have been processed incorrectly. And the worst part? There was no traditional database to query for historical event data.  

I knew this wasn’t just a simple bug fix. This was a data recovery challenge—one that needed to be solved without downtime, without disrupting the event stream, and at scale.

## Understanding the Problem:  

- **Event-driven architecture**: The system relies on real-time processing.
- **Missed & incorrect events**: Need a way to detect and correct them.
- **No traditional database**: We can't query past data but can leverage event logs, stateful processing, and streaming frameworks.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle millions of events per hour efficiently.

So, how do we do it?
