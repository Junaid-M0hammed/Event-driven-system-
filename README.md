# Recovering Lost Events in a Streaming System 

Everything was running smoothly. Our event-driven system was humming along, processing millions of real-time messages without breaking a sweat.  

Until one day… things didn’t quite add up.  

Numbers started looking *off*. Reports weren’t matching up. Some events were missing entirely, and others seemed to have been processed incorrectly. And the worst part? There was no traditional database to query for historical event data.  

I knew this wasn’t just a simple bug fix. This was a data recovery challenge—one that needed to be solved without downtime, without disrupting the event stream, and at scale.

## Understanding the Problem:  

- **Event-driven architecture**: The system relies on real-time processing.
- **Missed & incorrect events**: Need a way to detect and correct them.
- **No traditional database**: We can't query past data but can leverage event logs, stateful processing, and streaming frameworks.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle millions of events per hour efficiently.

So, how do we do it?

##  My Approach: 

I considered multiple approaches based on what data we had available and how much control we had over the system.  

### 1. If We Have Event Logs → Replay Events from Kafka or Kinesis  (Best Approach)

If our event bus retains past events (like Kafka does with its log retention), we can simply replay the missing events.  

#### How?  
- Identify the range of missing events from logs or monitoring data.  
- Use Kafka’s `seek()` function (or similar for other message buses) to reprocess only the necessary events.  
- Ensure idempotent processing so we don’t accidentally double-count any event.  

#### Code snippet: Kafka Replay in Python  
**Best For:** Systems where event logs exist and retention is enabled.  
**Downside:** Needs event retention in Kafka/Kinesis.

### 2. If We Have Stateful Processing → Restore from Checkpoints  

If the system is built using Apache Flink, Spark Streaming, or Kafka Streams, it’s possible to restore data from state checkpoints instead of replaying raw events.  

#### How?  
- Maintain stateful processing with regular snapshots.  
- When events go missing, roll back to the last valid checkpoint and reprocess only the affected data.  

#### Code snippet: Flink Checkpointing for Recovery  
**Best For:** Systems with stateful stream processing (Flink, Spark).  
**Downside:** Requires infrastructure for checkpointing.

### 3. If No Logs Exist → Infer Missing Data from Downstream Sources  

Sometimes, logs are gone, and checkpoints don’t exist. In that case, we need to rebuild the missing values based on what we do have—reports, API data, or raw logs from monitoring tools.  

#### Code snippet: Interpolating Missing Data in Python  
**Best For:** When no raw event logs exist.  
**Downside:** Less accurate than actual event replay.  

### Summary of My Approach
| **Approach**             | **When to Use** | **Advantages** | **Trade-offs** |
|-------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Replay Events (Kafka)** | Logs exist | Fully accurate, scalable | Requires event retention |
| **Restore from Checkpoints (Flink/Spark)** | Stateful processing | Fast, real-time correction | Infra complexity |
| **Approximation (ML/BI)** | No logs available | Works without logs | Less accurate |
